        <h1>Off The Record <br/>Birmingham Music Meetup</h1>

        <h2 id="what">What's a record club?</h2>
        <p><span class="otr">Off The Record</span> is a monthly event where a bunch of music-loving people get together
            to listen to a whole album in full &ndash; no distractions, no interruptions &ndash; and then talk about it
            afterwards. In a fast-paced world where we don't make time for music, it's about stopping and appreciating
            something new.</p>

        <h2 id="where" class="header">Where and when does it happen?</h2>
        <p><span class="otr">Off The Record</span> is hosted at <a href="http://www.cherryreds.com/">Cherry Reds</a> in
            <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cherry+Red's+Cafe+Bar/@52.4770694,-1.901214,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x58d505a04a9abddd">central
                Birmingham</a>. It's an evening event, running from 7pm-9.30pm or so, with 10-20 people attending. It's
            free â€“ if you like music and food/drinks, you are super welcome.</p>

        <h2 id="suggest" class="header">Got a record to suggest?</h2>
        <p>Cool &ndash; we have <a href="#guidelines">some guidelines on hosting a playback / discussion</a> below. Have
            a read and you'll eventually be able to submit your record suggestion where people can vote for it for an
            upcoming <span class="otr">Off The Record</span> session. Or if you really can't wait, <a
                    href="mailto:matt@mattandrews.info">email Matt</a> with your nominations.</p>

    <h2 id="guidelines">Session Guidelines</h2>
    <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>Sessions will cover two albums maximum, although I've found one works best (plus some singles!). If you want
            to run a session (please do!), think about a theme which will encourage other people to contribute: you can
            play the main album, but we want other people to bring songs/singles which complement it.
        </li>

        <li>It might be good to come pre-prepared with some talking points about your nominations, for example: what do
            you think of the lyrics to "Ziggy Stardust"? How does the guitar interplay with the other instruments? Was
            the producer on vacation for the final two songs?! Write down a few notes to get things moving so we can
            chat after we're done listening.
        </li>

        <li>If you were going to introduce an open-minded newbie to a favourite genre or artist, what albums would you
            pick? Think about how they'll come across to a new listener and contextualise them: before playing them, you
            could say a few words to talk about the social climate or musical landscape the album was recorded and
            released in. This is about appreciating music and learning why it's so great.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2 id="about">Who's behind this?</h2>
        <p><span class="otr">Off The Record</span> is an experimental project by <a href="http://mattandrews.info">Matt
            Andrews</a>, a music loving web developer. While it's far from the first event of its kind, we wanted to
            create something where people could make time for good music and hear people talk passionately about why
            it's great.</p>
        <p>I moved from London to Birmingham in June 2015 and have restarted <span class="otr">Off The Record</span> in
            my new home city. I'm excited to see what the home of metal can bring to our little event, although we're
            unlikely to play any Sabbath (sorry, Ozzy).</p>
