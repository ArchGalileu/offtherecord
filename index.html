                <p class="caption">The album we'll be listening to is My Bloody Valentine's 1991 release "Loveless". The second album by the Irish band, it took two years to record across nineteen studios. It didn't sell hugely well but was well received critically, but ultimately led to label Creation Records dropping the band, in part due to the expenses and challenges presented by frontman Kevin Shields and his recording techniques.

                </aside>

                <article>
                    <p>Local pop-punk aficionado Joe Bell hosted this edition of OTR and we listened to the longest
                        album so far &ndash; quite an achievement. Most of us hadn't heard Say Anything before and
                        reactions were mixed. Their second album, it was originally intended to be a rock opera, but frontman/main songwriter Max Bemis suffered a mental breakdown during recording and part of the concept was scrapped. It's considered a masterpiece of the pop/punk/emo/indie genre today and is 57:55 long – pushing the boundaries for the genre.</p>
                    <p>The album was complex and had a lot going on lyrically and musically, with song subjects
                        ranging from the Holocaust, criticism of the punk scene and weird love ballads. Most of the
                        attendees rated it around a 5/10 but everyone seemed to find something to enjoy within the
                        record. Whether it converted anyone to a fan of the band (or genre) remains to be seen but
                        Joe's personal connection with the album (he was a similar age when it was recorded by a 19
                        year old Bemis) sent the group off reminiscing about being that age.</p>
                    <p>Songs suggested by the group to match the theme "Suffering For Art" included Snoop Dogg's
                        "Gin & Juice" (apparently Dr. Dre insisted Snoop re-record the vocal dozens of times until
                        it was "perfect"); the drug-induced beauty/horror of John Frusciante's solo work; a live
                        performance of a Nina Simone song; a recent Sufjan Stevens song about the death of his
                        mother and a couple more hits from the emo/pop-punk world inhabited by Say Anything.</p>

                <h6 class="record-list"><strong>Record:</strong> Big Star &ndash; <em>Radio City</em></h6>

                    <p class="caption">Our last-minute album change!</p>
                </aside>

                <article>
                    <p>Well... it took a while, but we had a followup to last year's first Birmingham-based Off The
                        Record! Calum Mayer hosted the session and initially chose Big Star's ambitiously-titled <em>Number 1 Record</em>, their debut album released in 1972. The US power-pop group recorded the album after being hugely inspired by the Beatles, but it sold less than 10,000 copies due to poor distribution and the band fractured. The theme he chose was "Cult Failures", which was fine &ndash; but then Calum texted me the evening before the event
                        to suggest a last-minute change to the followup album, <em>Radio City</em>.</p>
                    <p>We went with the change, deciding that (sadly for Big Star) it still fit the theme.
                            Reactions on the night were mixed: people could hear the influence Big Star went on to
                            have on later artists, appreciated the lyrical wordplay (and ambiguities at times) and
                            the musicianship. The first side of the album was perhaps less appreciated, being slower
                            and a bit slow to get going, but we ended the record with perhaps a few curious converts
                            .</p>
                    <p>Afterwards we heard songs from artists suggested by the group, including early 70s
                        proto-punks Death, 60s folk singer Vashti Bunyan, some of the Cure's early material, early
                        Indian experiments in rave and the sublime Nick Drake.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>A relaunch! That's right, Off The Record has moved to Birmingham and this was our first event
                    in our new home &ndash; hence "Re-runs" as a theme. Townes Van Zandt's self-titled third record, released in 1969 qualified as a re-run because he re-recorded four songs from his 1968 debut which he felt were too overproduced on the original recordings.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/records/townes.jpg" width="120" class="float-right" />

                    <p>Most of the group were new to Townes' music which was quite a nice opportunuity to introduce
                        them to his mournful poetry. A standout moment was the utter bleakness of "Waitin' Around To
                    Die" (with one attendee even asking to hear it again at the end, clearly not satisfied with just
                    the one rendition of the lyrics about robbery, drug addiction, cheating and alcoholism). For
                        myself the highlight was the beautiful tearjerker "None But The Rain" (play this one at my
                        funeral, friends).</p>
                    <p>Despite the melancholy of Townes' music we didn't all descend into a pit
                        of despair, and the group shared some good songs afterwards &ndash; Lyle shared Torre
                        Florim's interpretation of the Prodigy's "Firestarter", Chris played us John Mayer's version
                    of Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'", and Connie and Hannah shared Placebo's cover of the Kate Bush
                        classic "Running Up That Hill". Some good choices and a good event for our relocation to the
                    Midlands.</p>

                    <p>Curated by meetup #1 veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanatsmith">Dylan Smith</a>, we followed the theme Artists Who Went Solo. Dylan spun the first solo record released by Morrissey after the Smiths imploded, 1988‘s <em>Viva Hate</em>.</p>

                    <p>An intrepid group of music lovers met to listen to Morrissey's solo debut, famously released just six months after the Smiths' final record. Dylan, who chose the record and theme, talked about his love for Moz (he even has a tattoo) but how even he wasn't completely sure about this record. </p>

                    <img src="assets/img/records/moz.jpg" width="120" class="float-right" />

                    <p>Minor excitement occurred when we realised that the controversial closer, "Margaret on the Guillotine" was about the death of the eponymous Mrs. Thatcher, the anniversary of whose death was the day after the meetup. This could've seen the event degenerate into a political riot but instead we shared some interesting songs after the record was finished, including interesting cover versions and bizarre solo efforts.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Off The Record’s debut event saw eight music-loving folk get together in the downstairs room of Coco Momo café in Holborn to listen to a couple of records separated by more than thirty years (not to mention genre). The two albums chosen (based on votes) were two debuts: Elvis Costello’s 1977 classic “My Aim Is True”, and The Tallest Man On Earth’s relatively recent 2008 debut full length, “Shallow Grave”.</p>
                    <p>As humble host and curator for the evening, I (Matt) can confess to a certain amount of trepidation beforehand, mostly involving fretting about the audio equipment and whether or not trying to transport a turntable across London would prove to be my undoing. Luckily, though, sound quality was pretty reasonable and more than adequate for the size of the room. People began to trickle in (which was my second fear: that nobody would show up) and soon we were ready to start. <span class="js-toggle toggler" data-toggle="js-event-summary-1">Keep reading...</span></p>
                    <div class="js-toggle-pane" id="js-event-summary-1">
                        <h4>Elvis Costello &ndash; My Aim Is True</h4>
                        <img src="assets/img/records/event1/elvis.jpg" width="120" class="float-right" />
                        <p>I kicked things off with a potted history of Elvis Costello (cribbed mainly from Wikipedia) but included one of my favourite tidbits about the album, namely the “help us hype Elvis” promo card that came with the LP and saw Stiff Records effectively run a peer-to-peer marketing campaign in the late 70s.</p>
                        <p>I talked briefly about my reasons for selecting the album, which were mainly aligned with my experience of pop-punk like Green Day and realising there were bands doing more mature, varied and groundbreaking stuff decades earlier – I pointed out that hearing a complex love song like “Alison” alongside punchy pop/rock singles made more sense to me as a young man (as I was when discovering this record).
                        </p>
                        <p>We sat in thoughtful silence (surprisingly, this didn’t feel awkward like I’d worried) and listened to the two sides, the only disturbance coming when I realised my UK edition didn’t have the final closing song “Watching the Detectives” so had to quickly switch to iTunes to make sure everyone got to hear this essential song.</p>
                        <p>Once we were done, it was over to the group to reflect. It turned out than only one other person there had heard the album before (and attended OTR on the strength of his love for it!) so everybody else was a newcomer. A couple of people were quite impressed: Elvis’s lyrics were repeatedly highlighted as clever and interesting, and some of the music was described as being good for background (say, at a party) where you might miss the subtleties or one-liners of some of the standouts.</p>
                        <p>People also spoke of the range of songwriting on display, with the references to 50s rock, reggae/dub, punk/new-wave and even country all on display in a relatively brief album. One person was surprised I’d highlighted “Alison” as an attraction when I was first discovering the record, which did leave me wondering how much I first appreciated that song when I was in full-on pop-punk mode. Someone else gave a convincing theory that “Alison” was in fact about a desire for the singer to murder his partner, which was a new one for me.</p>
                        <p>I was asked to rate the album which was a surprise but I came down on 8/10, highlighting the range of songwriting, lyrical smarts and punchiness of the overall sound. Even the detractors (who felt the slower songs weren’t always up to scratch) agreed and I think we averaged a 7/10 for the group as a whole. Congratulations, Elvis!</p>
                        <h4>Interval songs: Jenny Owen Youngs / The Hold Steady</h4>
                        <p>During the interval, Paul played a song by Jenny Owen Youngs called “From Here”, taken from her Batten The Hatches debut album. He talked about how he came across it and what he liked about it and we listened as a group and talked about the vocals, the unexpected changes in the chorus and how she replicated it live.</p>
                        <p>Dylan also jumped in with the opening song from the debut Hold Steady album, which was markedly downbeat (despite being called “Positive Jam”, from 2003’s Almost Killed Me). He talked about the storytelling in the song and the way the narrative threaded its way through their subsequent albums and characters. This one was popular too and I think may have gained a few fans.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Tallest Man On Earth &ndash; Shallow Grave</h4>
                        <img src="assets/img/records/event1/tallest.jpg" width="120" class="float-right" />
                        <p>Next up was the debut by Swedish folk singer Kristian Matsson, known as The Tallest Man On Earth (who, sadly, is actually quite short in real life). I talked about the obvious Dylan comparisons he always gets, and how I was initially taken to his music because of the strength of his guitar work, and later seeing him hold an entire festival crowd completely in the palm of his hand, all with just his voice and a single guitar. I also gave a quick disclaimer that the first time you heard his voice, you’d probably find it a bit weird/abrasive.</p>
                        <p>We got started and with only ten songs, “Shallow Grave” was even shorter than Elvis’s earlier debut. It started strong with plenty of head nodding and tapping feet from the audience, but gradually there was a feeling people were becoming weary of the record.</p>
                        <p>In almost no time (it felt), we were chatting through the album. This was much less universally popular: one person in particular turned out to be a huge fan and was already planning to book live tickets, but others found it repetitive and same-y. I admitted it wasn’t my favourite album of his, and in defence, I quickly played the first 30 seconds of one of his newer songs, pointing out the change in instrumentation and the more expansive songwriting. This might’ve persuaded a few folks to give poor Kristian a second chance but I don’t think he won too many new fans that evening. One criticism, perhaps, was that it was “genre music” where he did one thing and stuck with it, whereas Elvis brushed past a whole bunch of genres and standards in his debut.</p>
                        <h4>Closing notes / Manic Street Preachers</h4>
                        <p>Finally, Dominic played us the Manic Street Preachers’ “Little Baby Nothing” from their 1992 debut Generation Terrorists, complete with vocals by underage porn star Traci Lords, appropriate since the song is about sexual exploitation of women by men. We talked about the musical maturity, the brilliance of James Dean Bradfield’s vocals and their original plan to get Kylie Minogue to sing the vocal originally.</p>
                        <p>We wrapped things up at around 10.30pm and agreed it had been a good evening and we wanted to do it again – one piece of feedback was that the format might work better with one full album, then a collection of attendee-curated songs, introduced by each person, all matching a given theme or topic.</p>

        <h2 id="guidelines">Session Guidelines</h2>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>Sessions will cover two albums maximum, although I've found one works best (plus some singles!). If you want to run a session (please do!), think about a theme which will encourage other people to contribute: you can play the main album, but we want other people to bring songs/singles which complement it.</li>

            <li>It might be good to come pre-prepared with some talking points about your nominations, for example: what do you think of the lyrics to "Ziggy Stardust"? How does the guitar interplay with the other instruments? Was the producer on vacation for the final two songs?! Write down a few notes to get things moving so we can chat after we're done listening.</li>

            <li>If you were going to introduce an open-minded newbie to a favourite genre or artist, what albums would you pick? Think about how they'll come across to a new listener and contextualise them: before playing them, you could say a few words to talk about the social climate or musical landscape the album was recorded and released in. This is about appreciating music and learning why it's so great.</li>

            <h2 id="about">Who's behind this?</h2>
            <p><span class="otr">Off The Record</span> is an experimental project by <a href="http://mattandrews.info">Matt Andrews</a>, a music loving web developer. While it's far from the first event of its kind, we wanted to create something where people could make time for good music and hear people talk passionately about why it's great.</p>
            <p>I moved from London to Birmingham in June 2015 and have restarted <span class="otr">Off The Record</span> in my new home city. I'm excited to see what the home of metal can bring to our little event, although we're unlikely to play any Sabbath (sorry, Ozzy).</p>
